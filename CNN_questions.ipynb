The self-driving car model, specialized in recognizing road-related features, complements the cat/dog classifier, which excels in discerning animal characteristics. By employing ensemble learning techniques such as weighted averaging or voting, we aim to enhance the overall robustness and accuracy of decision-making. This approach addresses individual model biases, handles ambiguous cases more effectively, and leverages the diversity in data handling strategies learned by each model. Ultimately, the combination of outputs ensures a more reliable and adaptable system, capable of making well-informed decisions across a spectrum of scenarios."
